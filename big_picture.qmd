This comes from the file `big_picture.qmd`.

Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Try to write in the style of a news or popular article. Importantly, this page should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn't assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression or a complicated plot. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.

# Who Gets Hurt? What Chicago Crime Data Reveals About Racial Inequality

## Thesis / Goal
In Chicago, crime doesn't affect all communities equally. Our analysis shows that Black residents are significantly overrepresented among crime victims compared to their share of the population, while White residents are underrepresented. These disparities are not random—they reflect deep-rooted social inequities that shape who gets harmed, where, and how often.



## What You’re Looking At
### Figure 1: Racial Representation in Chicago – Crime Victims vs Population
This bar chart compares the racial makeup of crime victims to the general population in 2021, 2022, 2023.
Red bars show the racial distribution of the total population (Census data).
Blue bars show the racial breakdown of crime victims (Chicago Police Department data).

Key Insight: Black Chicagoans make up a disproportionately large share of victims, far exceeding their share of the population. Conversely, White residents are underrepresented among victims.

### Figure 2: Victim Demographics for Robbery by Gender and Race
This interactive stacked bar chart lets you explore who is most affected by different types of crime.
Use the filters to switch between crime types or focus on specific groups.
Each bar shows the racial composition of male and female victims.

Key Insight: For robbery, Black victims again dominate, regardless of gender. The racial imbalance outweighs gender differences, suggesting that systemic factors, like neighborhood exposure or policing patterns, which may be driving risk.

## Why It Matters
These visuals aren’t just numbers—they reflect how inequality plays out in everyday safety. If certain communities are consistently more exposed to harm, public policy, policing resources, and community support need to account for that. Understanding the mismatch between population and victimization helps spark more targeted and equitable solutions.






## Rubric: On this page


* Title
  * Your big picture page should have a creative/click-bait-y title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a how a news article or a magazine story might draw you in. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
* Interactive component
  * Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions?
* This page should be self-contained.
  
**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `#| echo: FALSE`.
