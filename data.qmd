# Data Overview and Cleaning

## 1. Data Source and Context

- **Primary Dataset**: [Violence Reduction - Victim Demographics - Aggregated](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Violence-Reduction-Victim-Demographics-Aggregated/gj7a-742p/about_data)
- **Publisher**: City of Chicago, collected by the **Chicago Police Department (CPD)**.
- **Purpose**: To track violent crime trends, especially gun-related victimization, across demographic groups to support public safety monitoring, resource allocation, and violence prevention strategies.
- **Curation Note**: The dataset is anonymized and aggregated quarterly to protect victim privacy. Rows with fewer than 3 incidents per quarter are removed, possibly underrepresenting rare or sensitive events (e.g., domestic violence, hate crimes).

## Data Cleaning Process and Documentation

This section outlines the full data cleaning procedure used to prepare the Chicago violence victimization dataset for analysis.

## Data Cleaning Script

The full data cleaning process described above was implemented in an R script, which can be accessed here: [clean_data.R](scripts/clean_data.R).

This script performs the following tasks:
- Imports the original dataset.
- Extracts and processes the year information.
- Identifies and handles missing values, including special handling for `GUNSHOT_INJURY_I` based on dataset documentation.
- Recodes racial categories to align with census data.
- Filters rows with excessive missingness.
- Saves the cleaned dataset as an `.rds` file for use in subsequent analysis.

By reviewing the `clean_data.R` file, readers can verify the cleaning steps and reproduce the cleaned data used in this report.



### Cleaning Objectives

The main goals of the cleaning process were to:
- Identify and handle missing or structurally unknown values.
- Recode and rename variables to improve interpretability.
- Ensure consistent formats for time-related and categorical fields.
- Maintain a self-contained, well-structured dataset ready for modeling and visualization.

### Packages Used

We used the following R packages beyond the base curriculum:
- `readr` – for efficient CSV import
- `dplyr` – for filtering, transforming, and joining datasets
- `ggplot2` – for data visualization
- `reshape2` – to structure matrix data for heatmap plotting
- `gridExtra` – for arranging multiple plots in a single layout

### Step 1: Import and Parse Data

We imported the dataset and extracted the year from the `TIME_PERIOD` field for time-based analysis. This allowed us to align police data with census years for comparative studies.
```{r,eval=FALSE}
Violence_raw <- read_csv("Violence_Reduction_-_Victim_Demographics_-_Aggregated.csv")
Violence_raw$Year <- substr(Violence_raw$TIME_PERIOD, 1, 4)
```


### Step 2: Detect and Separate Unknown Values

We identified unknown entries in key demographic and incident-related variables, such as `AGE`, `SEX`, `RACE`, `GUNSHOT_INJURY_I`, `PRIMARY_TYPE`, and others. The dataset was split into:
- A "clean" subset without any "UNKNOWN" values.
- A "dirty" subset containing one or more "UNKNOWN" entries, for further investigation.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
cols_check <- c("AGE", "SEX", "RACE", "JUVENILE_I", 
                "DOMESTIC_I", "GUNSHOT_INJURY_I", 
                "NUMBER_OF_VICTIMS", "PRIMARY_TYPE")

Violence_na <- Violence_raw %>%
  filter(if_any(all_of(cols_check), ~ .x == "UNKNOWN"))

Violence_clean <- Violence_raw %>%
  filter(if_all(all_of(cols_check), ~ .x != "UNKNOWN"))
```


### Step 3: Visualize Missingness

We visualized the frequency of "UNKNOWN" entries across variables and per row. This allowed us to:
- Identify that `GUNSHOT_INJURY_I` had a disproportionately high number of unknowns.
- Detect that most rows had only one missing value.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
unknown_counts <- colSums(Violence_raw[, cols_check] == "UNKNOWN")
unknown_df <- data.frame(Category = names(unknown_counts), Count = unknown_counts)

ggplot(unknown_df, aes(x = Category, y = Count, fill = Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Count of UNKNOWN Values in Each Category",
       x = "Category", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


### Step 4: Recode Structural Missingness

According to the dataset documentation, shooting injury data before 2010 was not recorded for non-homicides and was marked as `"UNKNOWN"`. We recoded these values into a new category to distinguish them from truly missing data.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
Violence_na <- Violence_na %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year),
         GUNSHOT_INJURY_I = ifelse(Year <= 2010 & GUNSHOT_INJURY_I == "UNKNOWN", 
                                   "Before2010", 
                                   GUNSHOT_INJURY_I))
```


### Step 5: Examine Multi-Variable Missingness

We examined rows with exactly two unknown fields and used heatmaps to detect patterns of co-missing values. We found that these records often reflected cases where individuals refused to provide demographic information, especially `RACE` and `SEX`.
```{r,eval=FALSE}
Violence_na$missing_count <- rowSums(Violence_na == "UNKNOWN")
df_missing_2 <- Violence_na[Violence_na$missing_count == 2, ]

vars <- c("AGE", "SEX", "RACE", "GUNSHOT_INJURY_I")
missing_matrix <- matrix(0, nrow = 4, ncol = 4, dimnames = list(vars, vars))

for (i in 1:nrow(df_missing_2)) {
  missing_vars <- names(df_missing_2[i, ])[df_missing_2[i, ] == "UNKNOWN"]
  if (length(missing_vars) == 2) {
    missing_matrix[missing_vars[1], missing_vars[2]] <- missing_matrix[missing_vars[1], missing_vars[2]] + 1
    missing_matrix[missing_vars[2], missing_vars[1]] <- missing_matrix[missing_vars[2], missing_vars[1]] + 1
  }
}
```



### Step 6: Final Filtering

To ensure analytic validity, we:
- Retained all rows with zero or one unknown value in the four critical columns (`AGE`, `SEX`, `RACE`, `GUNSHOT_INJURY_I`).
- Removed rows with two or more unknowns.
- Combined these cleaned rows with the previously clean dataset into a single final cleaned dataset.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
Violence_na <- Violence_na %>%
  mutate(GUNSHOT_INJURY_I = ifelse(GUNSHOT_INJURY_I == "Before2010", "UNKNOWN", GUNSHOT_INJURY_I))

Violence_na$missing_count <- rowSums(Violence_na == "UNKNOWN")

Violence_filtered <- Violence_na %>%
  filter(missing_count < 2) %>%
  select(-missing_count)

Violence_clean_missing <- bind_rows(Violence_clean, Violence_filtered)
```

### Visualizations of Victimization Patterns

Figure 1 and Figure 2 provide visual insights into the relationship between victim demographics and the type of violent crime.

**Figure 1**  shows the distribution of violent crime types across different genders. This visualization helps to identify whether certain crime types are disproportionately experienced by a specific gender group.

**Figure 2** (`race vs type`) illustrates the distribution of violent crime types across racial groups. By examining this figure, we can assess potential disparities in crime victimization patterns among different racial categories.

![`race vs type`](posts/2025-3-31-forth-blog-post/figure2.png)

These figures offer important context for understanding demographic trends in violent crime victimization and will inform subsequent statistical modeling.



### Renaming and Recoding

We created new variables and harmonized categorical values:
- Created `IS_SEXUAL_ASSAULT` as a binary indicator for modeling.
- Merged `WBH` and `WWH` racial codes into a unified `HIS` (Hispanic) category for compatibility with census data.
- Recoded all relevant categorical variables into factor types.

### Data Combination

We prepared a secondary dataset with demographic proportions for Chicago from the U.S. Census (ACS) for the years 1990–2020. These external data were structured into a compatible format to allow side-by-side comparisons with victimization proportions by race over time.

### Final Output

The result is a cleaned, structured dataset that:
- Minimizes bias from missing values.
- Preserves as much usable information as possible.
- Allows for demographic-based and time-based comparisons.
- Enables logistic modeling and visualization of race and sex effects on victimization patterns.
