## **Data Loading and Cleaning:**

-   During the data loading and cleaning process, several columns with
    missing values marked as "UNKNOWN" were identified, including "AGE,"
    "SEX," and "RACE." Notably, the "GUNSHOT_INJURY_I" column often
    shows "UNKNOWN" before 2010 due to unavailable shooting data, which
    is not treated as true missing information. The cleaning process
    focuses primarily on "AGE," "SEX," and "RACE." Around 1,000 records
    with two missing values—often due to suspects refusing to provide
    demographic information—are excluded. The final dataset retains rows
    with fewer than two missing values to ensure critical demographic
    data is available for analysis.

## **Data for Equity:**

-   Applying the principles of Beneficence, Respect for Persons, and
    Justice ensures a responsible and ethical approach to analyzing the
    Chicago Violence Reduction Dataset. Beneficence emphasizes
    maximizing the benefits of this dataset by using it to inform
    violence prevention strategies while minimizing harm by avoiding
    misinterpretation that could reinforce harmful stereotypes or
    justify over-policing. Respect for Persons highlights the importance
    of protecting victim privacy, acknowledging the limitations of
    missing demographic data and ensuring that data cleaning methods do
    not introduce bias or erase marginalized groups from analysis.
    Justice calls for fair representation in data use, recognizing that
    underreported crimes and the exclusion of non-index crimes create
    gaps that could misdirect policy decisions. To uphold these
    principles, transparency about data limitations is essential,
    findings should be contextualized to avoid misrepresentation, and
    the dataset should be used alongside other sources to develop
    equitable, community-driven solutions to violence prevention in
    Chicago.
