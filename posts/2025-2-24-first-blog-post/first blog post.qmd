## **Datasets Selection:**

1.  **School Attendance by Student Group and District, 2021-2022**

    <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-attendance-by-student-group-and-district-2021-2022>

    -   Data size: 2,019 rows and 12 columns

    -   Purpose: The dataset was collected to analyze student attendance
        rates across different public school districts in Connecticut
        for the 2021-2022 school year.

    -   Collection Method: The Connecticut State Department of Education
        (CSDE) likely gathered this data from public schools' attendance
        records. It includes breakdowns by student demographics,
        districts, and statewide averages.

    -   Use Case: The data helps identify attendance disparities among
        different student groups, supporting policy-making, funding
        allocations, and targeted interventions for at-risk students.
        For this project, we will work on analyzing the racial
        disparities

    -   Question: Attendance differences by race/ethnicity.

    -   Possible challenge: some missing data.

2.  **Adult Depression (LGHC Indicator) - Catalog (data.gov),
    2012-2018**

    <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/adult-depression-lghc-indicator-627e3>

    -   Data size : 162 rows, 8 columns

    -   Purpose: The data was collected as part of the California
        Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey to answer the
        question “Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional EVER
        told you that you have a depressive disorder (including
        depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression)?”

    -   Collection Method: Telephone interviews

    -   Are we able to clean the data: Yes

    -   Main questions hope to address: Has the proportion of adults
        diagnosed with depression changed between 2012 and 2018 based on
        race or other factors

    -   Challenges: Data and weighting come from the California
        Department of Finance, there may be differences from national
        reports. Also self-reporting could lead to underreporting or
        overreporting.
