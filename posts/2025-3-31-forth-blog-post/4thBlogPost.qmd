## **Key Trends Identified Through EDA:**

In earlier exploration, we observed two major patterns from the Chicago
violent crime dataset:

-   Gender Disparities: Males are significantly more likely to be
    victims of most violent crimes (assault, battery, homicide,
    robbery). However, females are disproportionately represented in
    sexual assault and human trafficking cases.

-   Racial Disparities: Black (BLK) individuals, especially males,
    consistently account for the highest number of victims in battery
    and homicide cases. However, when we break victim data down by both
    race and sex, more nuanced patterns emerge.

To explore these trends further, we selected two visualizations:

**Figure 1: Violent Crime Victimization by Sex**

This figure clearly shows that males dominate in victim counts across
nearly all violent crime categories—except for criminal sexual assault,
where female victims outnumber male victims by more than double. This
prompted us to investigate whether sex is a strong statistical predictor
of being a sexual assault victim.

**Figure 2: Violent Crime Victimization by Race and Sex**

By plotting both race and sex, we found strong intersectional patterns.
For example, Black males are disproportionately affected by homicide and
battery, while White Hispanic and White females appear more frequently
in sexual assault cases. This raises the question: how do race and sex
interact in shaping the risk of being a sexual assault victim?

Logistic Regression Model: Predicting Sexual Assault Victimization

To better understand this relationship, we fit a logistic regression
model with the following specification:

-   Response variable: IS_SEXUAL_ASSAULT (1 if the victim was recorded
    as such, 0 otherwise)

-   Predictors: SEX, RACE, and their interaction (SEX \* RACE)

We used ggeffects::ggpredict() to visualize the predicted probabilities.

Figure 3: Predicted Probability of Being a Sexual Assault Victim

This model output confirms our earlier observations:

-   Across all racial groups, females have significantly higher
    predicted probabilities of being sexual assault victims than males.

-   Males have near-zero probabilities, indicating that sex is by far
    the strongest predictor.

-   Among females, the probability varies by race:

    -   Highest: White Hispanic (WWH) and White Non-Hispanic (WHI)\
        Lower: Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and Indigenous (I)

These insights support the idea that both gender and race interact in
shaping crime victimization risk—especially for sensitive categories
like sexual assault.

Takeaways & Next Steps

-   We validated major EDA trends with modeling: being female greatly
    increases the odds of being a sexual assault victim, with race
    playing a secondary but still notable role.

-   These findings emphasize the importance of intersectional analysis
    when working with demographic data.

-   For next steps, we plan to:

    -   Include year as a variable to assess trends over time

    -   Explore other crime categories (e.g., battery, robbery)

    -   Consider other predictors such as age, domestic violence flag,
        or gun involvement
