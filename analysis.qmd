## **Motivation:**

Violent crime is a persistent issue in Chicago, with widespread concerns about how different communities are affected. Awareness and occurrences of discrimination-based crimes has been increasing in the last few decades. This analysis is focused on how race and gender correlate with being a victim of a violent crime in order to shed light on how social and systemic discrimination affects real-world safety and how these problems can be addressed.

The variables of interest are:

    -   race of victim
    -   sex of victim
    -   type of violent crime
    -   time period
    -   age of victim
    -   whether a victim has been shot

We are especially interested in examining the relationships between:

    -   race and type of violent crime
    -   sex and type of violent crime
    -   age and type of violent crime
    -   time period and type of violent crime

**A preview of the dataset:**

```{r}
tibble(Violence)
```

## **Some visualizations:**

1. **Examining the distribution of type of crime across races:**

```{r}
Violence |>
  ggplot(aes(x = PRIMARY_TYPE, fill = PRIMARY_TYPE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~RACE) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Victims of violent crimes in Chicago, divided by race"
  )
```

This gives some insight about the relationship between race and type of violent crime. It is clear that Black people in Chicago are disproportionately affected by assault and battery.

2. **Examining the distribution of type of crime among gender:**

```{r}
Violence |>
  ggplot(aes(x = PRIMARY_TYPE, fill = PRIMARY_TYPE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~SEX) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Victims of violent crimes in Chicago, divided by sex"
  )

```

This gives insight as to which sexes experience each crime the most frequently. It is clear that men are more commonly victims of every violent crime except for sexual assault and human trafficking. There is also a staggering difference between how many men have experienced battery and homicide versus how many women have experienced it.

3. **Examining the distribution of each crime across race AND sex:**

```{r}
Violence |>
  ggplot(aes(x = PRIMARY_TYPE, fill = PRIMARY_TYPE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(RACE ~ SEX) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Victims of violent crimes in Chicago, divided by sex and race"
  )
```
This table shows that among all the races and sexes, Black men are the most common group to be victims of violent crime, with Black women following closely behind.

4. **Examining the distribution of each crime across age:**

```{r}
Violence |>
  ggplot(aes(x = PRIMARY_TYPE, fill = PRIMARY_TYPE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(SEX~AGE) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Victims of violent crimes in Chicago, divided by sex and age group"
  )
```
This table reveals that men aged 19 and under are the most likely to be a victim of a violent crime in Chicago, and women aged 19 and under follow closely behind.

## **Modeling and Inference:**

**Predicting whether a victim has sustained a gunshot injury:**

Below is a logistic regression model that predicts whether or not a victim sustained a gunshot injury. This variable ("GUNSHOT_INJURY_I") is binomial, where "YES" means the victim sustained a gunshot injury, and "NO", The model is as follows:


```{r}

Violence$SEX <- as.factor(Violence$SEX)
Violence$RACE <- as.factor(Violence$RACE)
Violence$Year <- as.factor(Violence$Year)
Violence$GUNSHOT_INJURY_I <- as.factor(Violence$GUNSHOT_INJURY_I)

model_gunshot <- glm(GUNSHOT_INJURY_I ~ SEX + RACE + AGE,
                     data = Violence,
                     family = binomial)

summary(model_gunshot)

print(model_gunshot)

```

**Interpretations of the model:**

The predictor variables (age group, sex, race) each affect the odds of whether or not the victim was shot. The "Intercepts" column gives a value for how much each predictor variable affects the odds. For example, "SEXM" = 0.25276, "RACEBLK" = 0.37543, and "AGE30-39" = -0.04596. This means the victim being male increases their odds of being a gunshot victim by a factor of about 0.25276, being black increases their odds by a factor of about 0.37543, and being within the age group of 30-39 decreases their odds by a factor of about 0.04596. The odds should fall somewhere between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no chance of sustaining a gunshot injury, and 1 indicates 100% odds of sustaining a gunshot injury. The 'Error' column indicates the error margin of each intercept.


## **Flaws and Limitations:**

More detailed data that would be helpful includes the regions of the city where these crimes occurred. This could have helped with determining which areas are the most affected by crime. Having data of extra factors, such as context of the crime (i.e., domestic violence, gang-related violence, accidental crimes, police brutality, etc.) could have helped with analyzing why certain crimes against certain groups are more prevalent than others. Using only the given data forces the assumption that every part of the city is equally affected by crime, and anyone in any part of the city has equal odds of being a victim of a crime. Knowing more specific locations and contexts would have allowed for more accurate calculations and predictions.
