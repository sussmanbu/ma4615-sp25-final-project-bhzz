    "text": "Data Cleaning Process and Documentation\nThis section outlines the full data cleaning procedure used to prepare the Chicago violence victimization dataset for analysis.\n\nCleaning Objectives\nThe main goals of the cleaning process were to: - Identify and handle missing or structurally unknown values. - Recode and rename variables to improve interpretability. - Ensure consistent formats for time-related and categorical fields. - Maintain a self-contained, well-structured dataset ready for modeling and visualization.\n\n\nPackages Used\nWe used the following R packages beyond the base curriculum: - readr – for efficient CSV import - dplyr – for filtering, transforming, and joining datasets - ggplot2 – for data visualization - reshape2 – to structure matrix data for heatmap plotting - gridExtra – for arranging multiple plots in a single layout\n\n\nStep 1: Import and Parse Data\nWe imported the dataset and extracted the year from the TIME_PERIOD field for time-based analysis. This allowed us to align police data with census years for comparative studies.\n\n\nStep 2: Detect and Separate Unknown Values\nWe identified unknown entries in key demographic and incident-related variables, such as AGE, SEX, RACE, GUNSHOT_INJURY_I, PRIMARY_TYPE, and others. The dataset was split into: - A “clean” subset without any “UNKNOWN” values. - A “dirty” subset containing one or more “UNKNOWN” entries, for further investigation.\n\n\nStep 3: Visualize Missingness\nWe visualized the frequency of “UNKNOWN” entries across variables and per row. This allowed us to: - Identify that GUNSHOT_INJURY_I had a disproportionately high number of unknowns. - Detect that most rows had only one missing value.\n\n\nStep 4: Recode Structural Missingness\nAccording to the dataset documentation, shooting injury data before 2010 was not recorded for non-homicides and was marked as \"UNKNOWN\". We recoded these values into a new category to distinguish them from truly missing data.\n\n\nStep 5: Examine Multi-Variable Missingness\nWe examined rows with exactly two unknown fields and used heatmaps to detect patterns of co-missing values. We found that these records often reflected cases where individuals refused to provide demographic information, especially RACE and SEX.\n\n\nStep 6: Final Filtering\nTo ensure analytic validity, we: - Retained all rows with zero or one unknown value in the four critical columns (AGE, SEX, RACE, GUNSHOT_INJURY_I). - Removed rows with two or more unknowns. - Combined these cleaned rows with the previously clean dataset into a single final cleaned dataset.\n\n\nRenaming and Recoding\nWe created new variables and harmonized categorical values: - Created IS_SEXUAL_ASSAULT as a binary indicator for modeling. - Merged WBH and WWH racial codes into a unified HIS (Hispanic) category for compatibility with census data. - Recoded all relevant categorical variables into factor types.\n\n\nData Combination\nWe prepared a secondary dataset with demographic proportions for Chicago from the U.S. Census (ACS) for the years 1990–2020. These external data were structured into a compatible format to allow side-by-side comparisons with victimization proportions by race over time.\n\n\nFinal Output\nThe result is a cleaned, structured dataset that: - Minimizes bias from missing values. - Preserves as much usable information as possible. - Allows for demographic-based and time-based comparisons. - Enables logistic modeling and visualization of race and sex effects on victimization patterns."

This means the victim being male increases their odds of being a gunshot victim by a factor of about 0.25276, being black increases their odds by a factor of about 0.37543, and being within the age group of 30-39 decreases their odds by a factor of about 0.04596. The odds should fall somewhere between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no chance of sustaining a gunshot injury, and 1 indicates 100% odds of sustaining a gunshot injury. The ‘Error’ column indicates the error margin of each intercept."

Having data of extra factors, such as context of the crime (i.e., domestic violence, gang-related violence, accidental crimes, police brutality, etc.) could have helped with analyzing why certain crimes against certain groups are more prevalent than others. Using only the given data forces the assumption that every part of the city is equally affected by crime, and anyone in any part of the city has equal odds of being a victim of a crime.

The new dataset containing the variables of marital status, education level, personal income, and poverty status would provide more information and probably give more insights into the reasons for the crime conviction.\nInitial findings:\nAfter briefly looking through the new dataset, we found that while the black individuals make up only 27.9% of the population, they account for over 50% of homicide and battery victims. Other than that, as females represent around 51.5% of the population, in the sexual assault crimes, they are disproportionately represented, which will be the part we will continue exploring the reasons behind.\nPossible challenges and Next Steps:\nSince the race categorization in the new dataset is different from the victim data, and we are not quite sure about some race types in the victim data, it may be a problem we need to keep working on. And then we will start working on combining the data, making some visuals, and interpreting the results."

Beneficence emphasizes maximizing the benefits of this dataset by using it to inform violence prevention strategies while minimizing harm by avoiding misinterpretation that could reinforce harmful stereotypes or justify over-policing. Respect for Persons highlights the importance of protecting victim privacy, acknowledging the limitations of missing demographic data and ensuring that data cleaning methods do not introduce bias or erase marginalized groups from analysis. Justice calls for fair representation in data use, recognizing that underreported crimes and the exclusion of non-index crimes create gaps that could misdirect policy decisions. To uphold these principles, transparency about data limitations is essential, findings should be contextualized to avoid misrepresentation, and the dataset should be used alongside other sources to develop equitable, community-driven solutions to violence prevention in Chicago."

    "text": "Final Steps:\nAs our team approaches the final stages of the project, we’ve assessed our progress to identify areas of the project where more work is needed. We’ve successfully conducted an indepth analysis and produced several charts/graphs highlighting demographic differences in violent crime victimization in Chicago. Our visuals include clear breakdowns by sex and race, and support a story about inequalities in crime victimization. We’ve also formulated a preliminary narrative thesis highlighting the significant disparities based on sex and race to form the foundation of the Big Picture article.\nThe first task we still need to complete is the interactive dashboard component. We have a template and dataset ready, but we still need to finalize our Shiny dashboard to make sure it supports our narrative by allowing users to explore different demographics interactively. Also, we’re editing our Big Picture article’s to create an engaging, clear, and informative style similar to popular media. Next steps include finalizing a creative and engaging headline, finishing the explanatory text around each visualization, and making sure the interactive components flow with the narrative."

    "text": "The data comes from the City of Chicago’s government and is collected by the Chicago Police Department (CPD) to track and analyze violent crimes, with a specific focus on gun violence and its impact on different victim groups. The original dataset is publicly available on the city’s open data portal (link). The sample population includes all known and reported individual victims of serious violent index crimes within Chicago, aggregated and anonymized to protect privacy. However, there are several issues with how the data was collected. First, to protect victim anonymity, any row with fewer than three incidents per quarter is removed, which hides rare but critical events like domestic violence and hate crimes. Also, since the dataset only includes crimes reported to CPD, unreported incidents—especially among vulnerable populations—are missing. Additionally, by focusing only on FBI index crimes involving bodily harm, the dataset excludes other important types of violence, creating gaps in understanding the full scope of violence in Chicago.\nThis dataset is widely used for public safety monitoring, research, and supporting violence prevention initiatives. It serves as a foundational source for the Mayor’s Office Violence Reduction Dashboard, which provides up-to-date information on violent crime trends across the city. By including details such as whether a shooting occurred, demographic breakdowns, and crime classifications, the data helps city officials, community organizations, and researchers track violence trends, identify at-risk communities, and evaluate intervention strategies. Although no specific policies have been made directly from this dataset, the dashboard built from it helps guide community violence prevention and citywide interventions. Common questions asked about the dataset include which communities are most affected by violence, how trends change over time, and concerns about underreporting and data completeness."

First, to protect victim anonymity, any row with fewer than three incidents per quarter is removed, which hides rare but critical events like domestic violence and hate crimes. Also, since the dataset only includes crimes reported to CPD, unreported incidents—especially among vulnerable populations—are missing. Additionally, by focusing only on FBI index crimes involving bodily harm, the dataset excludes other important types of violence, creating gaps in understanding the full scope of violence in Chicago.\nThis dataset is widely used for public safety monitoring, research, and supporting violence prevention initiatives. It serves as a foundational source for the Mayor’s Office Violence Reduction Dashboard, which provides up-to-date information on violent crime trends across the city. By including details such as whether a shooting occurred, demographic breakdowns, and crime classifications, the data helps city officials, community organizations, and researchers track violence trends, identify at-risk communities, and evaluate intervention strategies. Although no specific policies have been made directly from this dataset, the dashboard built from it helps guide community violence prevention and citywide interventions. Common questions asked about the dataset include which communities are most affected by violence, how trends change over time, and concerns about underreporting and data completeness."

Our analysis shows that Black residents are significantly overrepresented among crime victims compared to their share of the population, while White residents are underrepresented. These disparities are not random—they reflect deep-rooted social inequities that shape who gets harmed, where, and how often."

Red bars show the racial distribution of the total population (Census data). Blue bars show the racial breakdown of crime victims (Chicago Police Department data).\nKey Insight: Black Chicagoans make up a disproportionately large share of victims, far exceeding their share of the population. Conversely, White residents are underrepresented among victims.  Interact with it here\n\n\nFigure 2: Victim Demographics for Robbery by Gender and Race\nThis interactive stacked bar chart lets you explore who is most affected by different types of crime. Use the filters to switch between crime types or focus on specific groups. Each bar shows the racial composition of male and female victims.\nKey Insight: For robbery, Black victims again dominate, regardless of gender. The racial imbalance outweighs gender differences, suggesting that systemic factors, like neighborhood exposure or policing patterns, which may be driving risk.  Interact with it here"

If certain communities are consistently more exposed to harm, public policy, policing resources, and community support need to account for that. Understanding the mismatch between population and victimization helps spark more targeted and equitable solutions."
