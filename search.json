A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.\nInitially, you will study one dataset but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components."

This folder will be ignored by git so you’ll have to manually sync these files across your team.\n\nSharing your data\nFor small datasets (&lt;50mb), you can use the dataset folder that is tracked by github. Stage and commit the files just like you would any other file.\nFor larger datasets, you’ll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named dataset-ignore. This will be ignored by git (based off the .gitignore file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github’s size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in dataset-ignore are synced across team members.\nYour clean_data.R file in the scripts folder is the file where you will import the raw data that you download, clean it, and write .rds file(s) (using write_rds) that you’ll load in your analysis page. If desirable, you can have multiple scripts that produce different derived data sets, just make sure to link to them on this page.\nYou should never use absolute paths (eg. /Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/ or C:\\MA415\\\\Final_Project\\). Instead, use the here function from the here package to avoid path problems.\n\n\nClean data script\nThe idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them. This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis. Note that you don’t need to run this script from every post/page. Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which will usually be .rds files. In your data page you’ll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes. To link to this file, you can use [cleaning script](/scripts/clean_data.R) wich appears as cleaning script."

The first step is to remove potential missing values. The columns that may contain missing values are as follows:\n“AGE”, “SEX”, “RACE”, “JUVENILE_I”, “DOMESTIC_I”, “GUNSHOT_INJURY_I”, “NUMBER_OF_VICTIMS”, “PRIMARY_TYPE”\nWe will now count the number of missing values in each of these columns.\n\nViolence_na &lt;- Violence_raw[apply(Violence_raw[, c(\"AGE\", \"SEX\", \"RACE\", \"JUVENILE_I\", \n                                                   \"DOMESTIC_I\", \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I\", \n                                                   \"NUMBER_OF_VICTIMS\", \"PRIMARY_TYPE\")], \n                                  1, function(row) any(row == \"UNKNOWN\")), ]\n\nViolence_remove_na &lt;- Violence_raw[!apply(Violence_raw[, c(\"AGE\", \"SEX\", \"RACE\", \"JUVENILE_I\", \n                                                            \"DOMESTIC_I\", \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I\", \n                                                            \"NUMBER_OF_VICTIMS\", \"PRIMARY_TYPE\")], \n                                           1, function(row) any(row == \"UNKNOWN\")), ]\n\n\nViolence_remove_na &lt;- Violence_remove_na %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))\n\nunknown_counts &lt;- colSums(Violence_raw[, c(\"AGE\", \"SEX\", \"RACE\", \"JUVENILE_I\", \n                                           \"DOMESTIC_I\", \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I\", \n                                           \"NUMBER_OF_VICTIMS\", \"PRIMARY_TYPE\")] == \"UNKNOWN\")\n\n\nunknown_df &lt;- data.frame(Category = names(unknown_counts), Count = unknown_counts)\n\nggplot(unknown_df, aes(x = Category, y = Count, fill = Category)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Count of UNKNOWN Values in Each Category\",\n       x = \"Category\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that GUNSHOT_INJURY_I has an extremely high number of missing values. However, according to the dataset definition:\n“Shooting data is not available before 2010, so all non-homicide victimizations prior to 2010 will be recorded as ‘UNKNOWN’.”\nIt seems that UNKNOWN in records before 2010 should not be considered as missing values. We will remove these “UNKNOWN” values from GUNSHOT_INJURY_I and then re-evaluate the missing values.\nAt the same time, we found that missing values exist only in “AGE”, “SEX”, “RACE”, and “GUNSHOT_INJURY_I”.\nIn the following sections, we will focus our analysis on these four columns.\nNext, we will visualize the results by generating two plots:\n1. The distribution of missing values per row.\n2. The distribution of missing values per column.\n\nViolence_na &lt;- Violence_na %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year),\n         GUNSHOT_INJURY_I = ifelse(Year &lt;= 2010 & GUNSHOT_INJURY_I == \"UNKNOWN\", \n                                   \"Before2010\", \n                                   GUNSHOT_INJURY_I))\n\nViolence_na$missing_count &lt;- rowSums(Violence_na == \"UNKNOWN\")\n\nmissing_summary &lt;- table(Violence_na$missing_count)\n\nvariable_missing_counts &lt;- colSums(Violence_na == \"UNKNOWN\")[c(\"AGE\", \"SEX\", \"RACE\", \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I\")]\n\nmissing_summary_df &lt;- data.frame(Missing_Count = as.numeric(names(missing_summary)), \n                                 Count = as.numeric(missing_summary))\n\nvariable_missing_df &lt;- data.frame(Variable = names(variable_missing_counts), \n                                  Count = as.numeric(variable_missing_counts))\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(missing_summary_df, aes(x = factor(Missing_Count), y = Count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of UNKNOWN Values per Row\", \n       x = \"Number of UNKNOWN Values\", \n       y = \"Row Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(variable_missing_df, aes(x = Variable, y = Count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"coral\") +\n  labs(title = \"Number of UNKNOWN Values per Variable\", \n       x = \"Variable\", \n       y = \"Count of UNKNOWN Values\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\ngrid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that the missing values in “GUNSHOT_INJURY_I” have been reduced to zero. This suggests that all missing values in “GUNSHOT_INJURY_I” were caused by the dataset’s counting rules.\nAmong “AGE”, “SEX”, and “RACE”, having a single missing value might be acceptable. Before analyzing rows with two missing values, we refer to the Chicago Police Department’s definitions of “UNKNOWN” in “SEX” and “RACE” as follows:\n(https://www.cpdwiki.org/wiki/quick_reference/race_codes)\nRace Definitions\n\nBLK: A person having origins in any black racial groups of Africa.\n\nWHI: A person having origins in any of the peoples of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East.\n\nWBH: A person having origins in any black racial groups of Africa and is of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin.\n\nWWH: A person having origins in any of the peoples of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East and is of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin.\n\nI: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North America and who maintains cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community recognition.\n\nAPI: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands; this area includes, for example, China, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippine Islands, Samoa, etc.\n\nUnknown: A person whose racial and/or ethnic origin is unknown or one who refuses to disclose their racial and/or ethnic origin.\n\nGender Definitions\n\nMale (M)\n\nFemale (F)\n\nNon-binary (N)\n\nUnknown or declined to answer (X)\n\nWe are curious about how rows with two missing values are distributed, so we visualize the missing value patterns using a heatmap.\n\nViolence_na$missing_count &lt;- rowSums(Violence_na == \"UNKNOWN\")\ndf_missing_2 &lt;- Violence_na[Violence_na$missing_count == 2, ]\n\nvars &lt;- c(\"AGE\", \"SEX\", \"RACE\", \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I\")\nmissing_matrix &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = 4, ncol = 4, dimnames = list(vars, vars))\n\nfor (i in 1:nrow(df_missing_2)) {\n  missing_vars &lt;- names(df_missing_2[i, ])[df_missing_2[i, ] == \"UNKNOWN\"]\n  if (length(missing_vars) == 2) {\n    missing_matrix[missing_vars[1], missing_vars[2]] &lt;- missing_matrix[missing_vars[1], missing_vars[2]] + 1\n    missing_matrix[missing_vars[2], missing_vars[1]] &lt;- missing_matrix[missing_vars[2], missing_vars[1]] + 1\n  }\n}\n\nheatmap_data &lt;- as.data.frame(as.table(missing_matrix))\ncolnames(heatmap_data) &lt;- c(\"Variable1\", \"Variable2\", \"Count\")\n\nggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = Variable1, y = Variable2, fill = Count)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"white\", high = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Missing Value Pairs\", \n       x = \"Variable\", \n       y = \"Variable\", \n       fill = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll cases with two missing values result from suspects refusing to provide information. Since this data accounts for only around a thousand records, we consider it of limited value and will exclude these cases from our analysis.\n\nViolence_na &lt;- Violence_na %&gt;%\n  mutate(GUNSHOT_INJURY_I = ifelse(GUNSHOT_INJURY_I == \"Before2010\", \"UNKOWN\", GUNSHOT_INJURY_I))\nViolence_na$missing_count &lt;- rowSums(Violence_na == \"UNKNOWN\")\nViolence_filtered &lt;- Violence_na %&gt;% filter(missing_count &lt; 2) %&gt;% select(-missing_count)\nViolence_clean_missing &lt;- bind_rows(Violence_remove_na, Violence_filtered)\n\n\n\nComparing Chicago Crime Data by Race with U.S. Census Data\nNext, we will compare the racial distribution in Chicago crime data with the racial demographics from the U.S. Census for Chicago.\nThe crime dataset spans from 1991 to 2025, while census data is available for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020.

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

For this project, we will work on analyzing the racial disparities\nQuestion: Attendance differences by race/ethnicity.\nPossible challenge: some missing data.\n\nAdult Depression (LGHC Indicator) - Catalog (data.gov), 2012-2018\nhttps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/adult-depression-lghc-indicator-627e3\n\nData size : 162 rows, 8 columns\nPurpose: The data was collected as part of the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey to answer the question “Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional EVER told you that you have a depressive disorder (including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression)?”\nCollection Method: Telephone interviews\nAre we able to clean the data: Yes\nMain questions hope to address: Has the proportion of adults diagnosed with depression changed between 2012 and 2018 based on race or other factors\nChallenges: Data and weighting come from the California Department of Finance, there may be differences from national reports. Also self-reporting could lead to underreporting or overreporting.\n\nViolence Reduction - Victim Demographics - Aggregated\nViolence Reduction - Victim Demographics - Aggregated - Catalog\n\nData size: 55676 row 11 col\nPurpose: This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January – March, April – June, July – September, October – December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence.\nCollection methods: The data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department’s (CPD) case system and synchronized with the data on the Mayor’s Office Violence Reduction Dashboard.\nAre we able to clean the data: Yes\nMain question to address: Do different ethnic groups have a particular preference for certain types of crimes, and is this preference related to specific geographic areas?\nChallenge: To protect the privacy of victims, some data has been obfuscated, reducing the efficiency and accuracy of the dataset. There is a significant amount of “Unknown” values, which may require data supplementation or cleaning."

The cleaning process focuses primarily on “AGE,” “SEX,” and “RACE.” Around 1,000 records with two missing values—often due to suspects refusing to provide demographic information—are excluded. The final dataset retains rows with fewer than two missing values to ensure critical demographic data is available for analysis."

    "text": "Data for Equity:\n\nApplying the principles of Beneficence, Respect for Persons, and Justice ensures a responsible and ethical approach to analyzing the Chicago Violence Reduction Dataset. Beneficence emphasizes maximizing the benefits of this dataset by using it to inform violence prevention strategies while minimizing harm by avoiding misinterpretation that could reinforce harmful stereotypes or justify over-policing. Respect for Persons highlights the importance of protecting victim privacy, acknowledging the limitations of missing demographic data and ensuring that data cleaning methods do not introduce bias or erase marginalized groups from analysis. Justice calls for fair representation in data use, recognizing that underreported crimes and the exclusion of non-index crimes create gaps that could misdirect policy decisions. To uphold these principles, transparency about data limitations is essential, findings should be contextualized to avoid misrepresentation, and the dataset should be used alongside other sources to develop equitable, community-driven solutions to violence prevention in Chicago."

    "text": "Additional Dataset:\n&lt;https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2023.S0601?q=Chicago+Demographics&gt;\nWe combined our violent crime victim data with 2023 ACS 1-Year estimates for Chicago, which provide demographic breakdowns of sex and race across the city.\nCombining the data:\nWe can use the TIME_PERIOD, RACE, and AGE variables in the victim dataset to connect with the RACE, AGE, and YEAR variables in this demographics dataset. The new dataset containing the variables of marital status, education level, personal income, and poverty status would provide more information and probably give more insights into the reasons for the crime conviction.\nInitial findings:\nAfter briefly looking through the new dataset, we found that while the black individuals make up only 27.9% of the population, they account for over 50% of homicide and battery victims. Other than that, as females represent around 51.5% of the population, in the sexual assault crimes, they are disproportionately represented, which will be the part we will continue exploring the reasons behind.\nPossible challenges and Next Steps:\nSince the race categorization in the new dataset is different from the victim data, and we are not quite sure about some race types in the victim data, it may be a problem we need to keep working on. And then we will start working on combining the data, making some visuals, and interpreting the results."

The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting.
